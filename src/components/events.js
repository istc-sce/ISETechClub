                                            An interesting and informative 3 hours session on how to start off with competitive programming. 
                                            Aim of this workshop was to motivate students to participate in competitive programming and improve 
                                            their problem analysis skills. Programming is an extremely creative profession, it is a logic based 
                                            creativity. We taught them some programming techniques and analysis of the problems. It waas a very 
                                            good interactive session where we got well response from the students. Techniques on how to program 
                                            and why to program were taught, which motivated learners to think in a different perspective.
